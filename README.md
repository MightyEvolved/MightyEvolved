### Hi there 👋
I'm MightyEvolved and I'm super excited that 🐼's are coming back to San Diego! This is my first time creating anything on GitHub, very exciting!

🔭 I’m currently working on my first GitHub excercises.

🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps through the University of San Diego.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on leadership practices with a focus on Information Technology.

🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding Git and GitHub a little better.

💬 Ask me about my background in IT Operations.

📫 How to reach me: carrier pigeon 😆
